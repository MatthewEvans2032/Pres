        <h2>About Matthew</h2>
        <p>From construction sites to corporate boardrooms, my life's journey embodies resilience and hard work. I began working at 14 in construction, later serving at Walmart, laboring in a factory for Honda, and entering the tech world at Chase. My diverse experience and overcoming adversities like homelessness give me a profound understanding of the American struggle. As I transition into public service, my aim is to represent the voiceless and bring impactful changes to our community.</p>
