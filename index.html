        <h2>About Matthew</h2>
        <p>From construction sites to corporate boardrooms, my life's journey embodies resilience and hard work. I began working at 14, and my path has taken me from Walmart to Honda, to the tech world at Chase, and now to the Kentucky Education Department. This diverse experience, along with overcoming adversities like homelessness, has given me a profound understanding of the American struggle. As I transition into public service, my goal is to represent the voiceless and bring real impact to our community.</p>
